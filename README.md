A very basic cootie catcher, pretty much all you need.

I'm it public because I want to interact with cool people, but... please don't steal my cootie catcher!

live at https://cootie-catcher.com

because cootiecatcher.com was already taken.

If you're tempted to clone repo and shell out thousands of USD just own the non-hyphenated competitor...

...cool.

But do please reach out, or consider reaching out, first before you make any big decisions.

Our fortunes may depend on it!
